# 🛠️ Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Projects** repository by [sudo-su-ayan-ali](https://github.com/sudo-su-ayan-ali)!  
This repository is a collection of various cybersecurity and infosec-related tools and experiments.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This repository showcases a variety of Python-based cybersecurity tools built for **learning**, **research**, and **ethical hacking** purposes. These projects cover core areas such as reconnaissance, web vulnerability testing, keylogging, and cryptographic hash cracking. They aim to help beginners and intermediate learners understand how real-world hacking techniques work—while emphasizing ethical usage.

Each tool is designed with simplicity and modularity in mind, making it easy to explore and modify for educational penetration testing scenarios or Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.

> ⚠️ All tools are strictly for legal and authorized testing in controlled environments.

## 📁 Projects

Below is a brief overview of the sub-projects in this repository:

### 🔍 Recon + Subdomain Enumerator
A tool focused on reconnaissance and subdomain enumeration. Useful for asset discovery and information gathering during a penetration test or bug bounty.

**Features:**
- Collects hosts using OSINT
- Subdomain enumeration
- Passive and active scanning

---

### 🖥️ Keylogger
A basic keylogger for educational or ethical testing purposes.

**Features:**
- Logs keystrokes
- Saves activity in a file
- Minimal & easy-to-use implementation

> ⚠️ Note: **Only use this module in a controlled, ethical, and legal environment.**

---

### 🧪 XSS Hardcore Lab
A set of scripts and tools focused on testing and practicing **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks.

**Features:**
- Lab-like environment
- Payload injection
- Filters and bypass testing

---

### 🕵️ XSS Scanner
A script or tool built to scan targets for XSS vulnerabilities.

**Features:**
- Detects reflective/stored XSS
- Payload-based detection
- Simple and fast scanning

---

### 🔐 Hash Cracker (MD5 / SHA1)
A command-line tool to crack hashes using a wordlist attack (dictionary attack).

**Features:**
- Supports `md5` and `sha1`
- Uses custom wordlists (e.g., rockyou.txt)
- Simple interface for learning and testing
